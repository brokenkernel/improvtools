# I often work offline. This is a another TODO instead of github
- move jquery and other such things to local static so it works offline
- add widget support for suggestions
- reorder suggestions: https://github.co/Calvin-LL/Reorderable/
- actually move components to components module. This should allow 'internal' to be meaningful.
- I am misusing viewmodels for many aspects. Fix this.
- add bottom bar navigation
- move features out to different module from main application
- move feature logic out out to lib which doesn't have android dependencies
